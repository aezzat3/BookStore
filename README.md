### File Structure

- **`src`**: Contains all the source code.
  - **`components`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`navigation`**: Navigation setup and screens.
  - **`services`**: API service functions.
  - **`types`**: TypeScript type definitions.
  - **`utils`**: Utility functions and helpers.
  - **`store`**: State management (e.g., for favorites).
